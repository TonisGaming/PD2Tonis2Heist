"heist_Tonis2_brief" : "Oh man, it sure has been a hot minute huh? Well, I finally got a new job, but that old intel fell through, so, we're just going to hit GenSec and Murkywater head on. \n\nThis port is the weakest link, that I could find for both GenSec and Murkywater, so we're going to abuse that weak link. We need their info, to find any potential future targets and of course, just to throw some salt on the wound, why don't we also cause some chaos. \n\nEither hit GenSec, Murkywater or both, it's completely your choice, just make sure to get the job done in one piece.",
"ton2_vo_spawn" : "Alright, this is how far as I can get you. Find a way into the compound.", -
"ton2_vo_enter" : "That's the easy part out of the way, find a way down. Murkywater or GenSec, it's your choice or hell, why not even both.", -
"ton2_vo_gensecbreaker" : "Just pull the plug and GenSec will be completely blind.", -
"ton2_vo_murkybreaker" : "I heard that Murkywater are trying to hide their camera rooms in plain sight, keep an eye out.", -
"ton2_vo_manifestbreaker" : "This should kill the ports cameras, and possibly some GenSec ones, as they're on the same network.", -
"ton2_vo_firstextraloot" : "This'll cost them a penny, but it will make us a dime.", -
"" : "",
"ton2_vo_gensec_done" : "Now that we're done with GenSec, maybe you'll want to go after Murkywater aswell?",
"ton2_vo_murky_done" : "Our good old PMC friends are done and dusted, but perhaps you want to deal with a poor security company now?",
"ton2_vo_murky1s" : "Murkywater is tight on security, tapping straight into their servers would blow our cover. Find a terminal and I'll find us a safe way in.", -
"ton2_vo_murky1l" : "God damnit, Murkywater pulled the power. If we're gonna want to do anything we gotta get the power up, there should be a generator somewhere near. Fuel it and then lets find a way in.", -
"ton2_vo_murky_generatorfound" : "That's the generator, find some fuel and get it running.", -
"ton2_vo_murky_generator_90seconds" : "The generator has enough juice for a minute and a bit extra. Don't let her run dry.", -
"ton2_vo_murky_generator_45seconds" : "The generator is starting to get thirsty guys, real thirsty. Find some more fuel.", -
"ton2_vo_murky_generator_empty" : "The generator's out. We need it operational, if we want to continue this endeavour.", -
"ton2_vo_murky1l_hack1" : "Alright, power's back on. Wire me in to a terminal, I'll find the info.", -
"ton2_vo_murky1l_hack1_half" : "Half way there, just hold on.", -
"ton2_vo_murky1l_hack1_done" : "I'm gonna need to get the encryption keys. Wire me straight into their servers, shouldn't take too long.", -
"ton2_vo_murky1l_hack2_nopower" : "That isn't really gonna help, if there's no power, is it?",
"ton2_vo_murky1sfirewall1" : "We've hit a firewall, go find a box to rewire for access.", -
"ton2_vo_murky1sfirewall2" : "How many firewalls are in this system? You're gonna need to rewire a box to bypass it.", -
"ton2_vo_murky1sfirewall3" : "Why does a random Murkywater location like this have so many hoops to jump through? Find another box to rewire.", -
"ton2_vo_murky1sfirewall4" : "Firewall after firewall, gonna need a bypass for this one.", -
"ton2_vo_murky2s" : "Alright, I have a connection, but the actual servers are missing. It says they're getting ready to be shipped away, go find them.", -
"ton2_vo_murky2l" : "I'm connected, but there's a local element, that's blocking complete access. I'm gonna need you to eliminate the officer that is on site.", -
"ton2_vo_murky3s" : "Jup, those are the servers. Haul them to the control room and hook them up, I can download the info remotely.", -
"ton2_vo_murky3l" : "He sure was ready for us, but that aside, the servers are getting ready to be shipped. Check the containers and find them.", -
"ton2_vo_murky3s_half" : "That's all the info off of this server. Get it back in the container and bring the second server here.", -
"ton2_vo_murky3s_done" : "That's all the info we want. Try to not get caught and get it in the container. I wiped the servers, so when the shipment does arrive at it's location, it will be worthless to them.", -
"ton2_vo_murky4s" : "We're gonna need to lock all the containers we opened to avoid suspicion. There should be container locks all around the area.", -
"ton2_vo_murky4l" : "We got the info, but Murkywater knows we're here. There's explosives around the place, use 'em to destroy the servers.", -
"ton2_vo_murky4lalt" : "I'm sending in Bile, we're taking the servers with us. He should be there in around 3 minutes.", -
"ton2_vo_murky4l2alt" : "Connect the magnet, this will be our way out of here aswell.", -
"ton2_vo_murky5s" : "Now that they're oblivious to their data being gone, lets do a bit more damage and sabotage their cargo. Plant C4 on the marked cargo, try to not get caught.", -
"ton2_vo_murky5l2" : "There's a Murkywater ship that just departed and we, are gonna sink it. Set up some ziplines and fly away.", -
"ton2_vo_murky5l2_enter" : "There's a hatch at the bow of the ship. Climb down and be ready for resistance.", -
"ton2_vo_murky5l2_plant" : "Get to the engines and plant the C4. Then run for your life, if you don't want a watery grave.", -
"ton2_vo_murky5l2_blow" : "Boom! That's one large shipment of Murkywater goods down the drain. You can collect your loot in the container and then use it to leave.", -
"ton2_vo_gensec1" : "For a security company, GenSec sure is vulnerable. Patch me in and I'll find a way into the vault for the documents.", -
"ton2_vo_gensec2s" : "Looks like there's a code for the vault. First, I need you to find the GenSec authorization manifest in the office building, so we can even use the code.", -
"ton2_vo_gensec2s_found1" : "That's the authorization manifest. Fax it to me.", -
"ton2_vo_gensec2s_receive1" : "Jup, got it. Now look around, there should be some files with a high ranking employees info on it somewhere.", -
"ton2_vo_gensec2s_found2" : "Doug Hawkins, Armored Transport division. Why is this file here? Doesn't matter, I guess I'll just use that info.", -
"ton2_vo_gensec3s" : "Find the control room, I've authorized a vault opening. I'll relay the code once you're there.", -
"ton2_vo_21" : "21", -
"ton2_vo_23" : "23", -
"ton2_vo_11" : "11", -
"ton2_vo_31" : "31", -
"ton2_vo_gensec3_fail" : "That was the wrong one, don't fuck it up again.", -
"ton2_vo_gensec3c" : "How can you fuck up something so simple more than three times? Give me a bit for plan B.", -
"ton2_vo_gensec4" : "Good job guys, the vault is opening. Grab the hard drive.", -
"ton2_vo_gensec2l" : "Hmmm, I'm gonna need a bit of time to find a way to open the vault. In the meantime, do some damage, the servers here contain vital GenSec info.", -
"ton2_vo_gensec3l" : "Hehe, no more info for you GenSec, but back to the vault. It has a failsafe when it overheats, so job's easy. Find some crowbars and jam those vents.", -
"ton2_vo_gensec3l_25" : "It's starting to heat up, we're on the right track.", -
"ton2_vo_gensec3l_50" : "Should be about half way done, getting closer.", -
"ton2_vo_gensec3l_75" : "Just a bit more, get ready for a hot breeze of air.", -
"ton2_vo_gensec4l" : "God is it hot, just get the hard drive and then we can deal with the physical content.", -
"ton2_vo_gensec5" : "Alright, that's the hard drive, but we're gonna need to deal with the evidence now, it'll gain us a favor with a certain someone. Either destroy it or secure it, I'll leave that up to you.", -
"ton2_vo_gensec6l" : "We have no more use for anything GenSec around here. Plant C4 around the warehouse, we're gonna burn it to the ground. Don't forget about the loot though, it may be optional, but as they say, greed is good.", -
"ton2_vo_gensec6s" : "Alright, as GenSec has a wide variety of clientell, we'll be bugging their product, so we can abuse it as a backdoor in the future. You never know where these will end up.", -
"ton2_vo_gensec7l" ; "The C4 is primed and ready to blow, get to a safe distance guys!", -
"ton2_vo_gensec7l_blow" : "Boom! Hahaha, bye bye GenSec warehouse, hello sweet payday.", -
"ton2_vo_escape_van" : "I'm sending in Twitch, he'll be there in 3 minutes.", -
"ton2_vo_escape_van_arrive" : "Twitch has arrived at the front gate, use the getaway or secure more loot." -
