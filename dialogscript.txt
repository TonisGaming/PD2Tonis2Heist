"ton2_vo_spawn" : "Alright, this is how far as I can get you. Find a way into the compound.",
"ton2_vo_enter" : "That's the easy part out of the way, find a way down. Murkywater or GenSec, it's your choice or hell, why not even both.",
"ton2_vo_gensec1" : "For a security company, GenSec sure is vulnerable. Patch me in and I'll find a way into the vault for the documents.",
"ton2_vo_murky1s" : "Murkywater is tight on security, tapping straight into their servers would blow our cover. Find a terminal and I'll find us a safe way in.",
"ton2_vo_murky1l" : "God damnit, Murkywater pulled the power. If we're gonna want to do anything we gotta get the power up, there should be a generator somewhere near. Fuel it and then lets find a way in.",-
"ton2_vo_gensec2s" : "Looks like there's a code for the vault. First, I need you to find the GenSec authorization manifest in the office building, so you can even use the code.",
"ton2_vo_gensec2l" : "Hmmm, I'm gonna need a bit of time to find a way to open the vault. In the meantime, just do some damage, there should be a local server farm, destroy it.",
"ton2_vo_murky1sfirewall1" : "We've hit a firewall, go find a box to rewire for access.",
"ton2_vo_murky1sfirewall2" : "How many firewalls are in this system? You're gonna need to rewire a box to bypass it.",
"ton2_vo_murky1sfirewall3" : "Why does a random Murkywater location like this have so many hoops to jump through? Find another box to rewire.",
"ton2_vo_murky1sfirewall4" : "Firewall after firewall, gonna need a bypass for this one.",
"ton2_vo_murky2s" : "Alright, I have a connection, but the actual servers are missing. It says they're getting ready to be shipped away, go find them.",
"ton2_vo_murky2l" : "I'm connected, but there's a local element, that's blocking complete access. I'm gonna need you to eliminate the officer that is on site.",
"ton2_vo_murky3s" : "Jup, those are the servers. Haul them to the control room and hook them up, I can download the info remotely.",
"ton2_vo_murky3l" : "He sure was ready for us, but that aside, the servers are getting ready to ship. Check the containers and find them.",
"ton2_vo_gensec3s" : "Alright, I can authorize the code input now. Get to the server room and be ready to press some button.",
"ton2_vo_gensec3l" : "Hehe, no more info for you GenSec, but back to the vault. It has a failsafe when it overheats, so job's easy. Find some crowbars and jam those vents.",
"ton2_vo_murky3s_half" : "That's all the info off of this server. Get it back in the container and bring the second server here.",
"ton2_vo_murky3s_done" : "That's all that I want. Try to not get caught and get it in the container. I also wiped the servers, so when the shipment does arrive at it's location, it will be worthless to them.",
"ton2_vo_gensec3l_25" : "It's starting to heat up, we're on the right track.",
"ton2_vo_gensec3l_50" : "Should be about half way done, getting closer.",
"ton2_vo_gensec3l_75" : "Just a bit more, get ready for a hot breeze of air.",
"ton2_vo_gensec4l" : "God is it hot, just get the hard drive and then we can deal with the physical content.",
